# Intro

Welcome to my coding notes. Check out the sidebar and read around :grinning:

These are rough, unorganized notes, mostly used by myself to learn. Hopefully some of them are useful for you as well :muscle::muscle::muscle:

I am slowly trying to organize them and make them more readable. Feel free to edit and PR the repo [here](https://github.com/Polcius/coding-notes-vuepress)

Hope you like it :kiss:

# Figma

## Shapes
- `Shift` while dragging retains proportions.
- `Shift + Option` retains proportions from the center. Ideal when we want to put a shape inside of another.

## Images
- They behave like a background to a shape, with properties like cover, fit, fill...
- We can add effects/filters/blending modes.
- If we "Place Image" on a shape, it will fit the image inside that shape.
- When creating a new shape, it automatically fills it with the grey color. We should delete it.

## Frames
- `Ctrl + D` => Duplicate frame

## Layer Effects
- `Up` and `Down` keys => +- 1
 - + `Shift` => +- 10
- Instead of an effect, we can add a fill and blend it.
- Background blur effect.

## Boolean Groups
- 2+ objects => combining two different shapes to make one.
- Flatten => convert into one shape.

## Alignment and distribution
- Alignment != Distribution.
- Select element and press `Shift` + `1` or `2` => zooming modes.
- Grouping many items to align them in regards to the canvas.

## Components
- Reusable pieces. Don't have to be equal every time. There is a Master Component and then Instances. Master Components are indicated by a split hexagon.

## Nested components
- Master components can be placed anywhere outside our frame; to build a library we can then place on our designs.

## Constraints 
- To pin it relative to the parent frame. We freeze the values, and can control the behavior when we resize elements.

## Presentation view
- You can get a shareable link and sent it to other people. They can click around and move around the presentation. If they click on the presenter's avatar, they will follow what you do.
- Prototyping mode allows you to simulate how your app would work. Your buttons can link to frames, deciding the workflow. If you link a Master component to a Frame, all Instances will retain what the Master links to. This is useful, for example, if we want a "Home" button which always links to Frame 1 (Home screen).

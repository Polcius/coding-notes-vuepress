# Design, UI/UX

- [Avoid common design mistakes](https://uxplanet.org/common-webpage-design-mistakes-59eed9831bd7)

- Spacing is really important. Make sure spacing between content is the same and follows a rationale.
- Using patterns and textures is cool. Examples:
  - [Subtle patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/)
  - [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/)
  - [True Grit Textures](https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/)
- Nice icons:

  - [Icons 8](https://icons8.com/icons)
- Using subtle gradients:
  - [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/gradient)
- Using subtle drop shadows
- Don't use true black and white. They are too harsh. Use softer variations. You can set CSS variables for `black` and `white` and then set these to softer variants.
- Default browser UI should be changed, especially checkboxes, selectors... Make sure to respect accessibility.
- Animations
  - Don't overuse them
  - Subtle scale/transitions on hover are nice
  - CSS transitions vs Physics based
  - Examples:
    - [Patagonia Bears Ears](http://bearsears.patagonia.com/)

- > Always use color to support something that your design is already saying; never use it as the only means of communication.
- > Always design and think about a system before starting to code. This means, define a set of values for spacing, text, color, etc. It saves a lot of time and helps give consistency to your designs. Do not tweak pixel by pixel like a madman: too much choice, in the end, is bad.
- > Bad photos will ruin a design, even if everything else about it looks great.
